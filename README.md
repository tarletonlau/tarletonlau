# 🌟 Tarleton Lau Zong Lum 🌟
## Full-Stack Developer | Economist wannabe
Hello there 👋 I'm Tarleton, an Economist by major but developer by heart. This change happened when I realised that I rather spend hours chasing bugs in VSCode, than spend hours waiting for Stata to load my dataset.

### 🚀 What I'm Up To:
Developing and implementing new solutions for Virtuals.
Continuing my journey in Computer Science and Economics.
Being a home-barista, reminiscing about kanelbullar, semla and Sweden's charm

### More About Me
From public worker to innovator: Journeyed from government work to engineering codes that might just change the world.


### 🌱 I’m currently learning...
The art of balancing academics and remote work.
Advanced coding techniques and frameworks to keep sharpening my full-stack skills.
How to bring a slice of Nordic work-life balance to Singapore.
